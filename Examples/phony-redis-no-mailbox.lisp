;;; According to a presentation by an Amazon Web Services engineer,
;;; one cannot design an in-memory database using a garbage collected
;;; language implementation, because it would be too slow due to
;;; collection.  He then goes to use a hash table with just one lock,
;;; copies the data to be stored just 'cause, finds performance similar
;;; to Redis, and calls it a day.

;;; Using structure sharing and a concurrent hash table, we can go
;;; much faster.  Perhaps a magnitude or two faster - not that I'm
;;; really taking the problem seriously, by avoiding network
;;; serialisation, and even inter-thread mailboxes; but this should
;;; show that tasteful use of concurrent data structures makes things
;;; go fast.
